# RandomPatrolGenerator

This is a little project  to make a new experience for ArmA 3 players.
Between DynamicReconOps, TRGM2 and DirectAction, RandomPatrolGenerator is a little missionGenerator, optimize to allow players to keep 60 FPS on modern configuration.
It can be played RP or Arcade style with one or two factions doing the same mission on different way.

Factions are manually implemented with a factionTemplate and every mission is different.

Initially made for hardcore player, there is settings to allow player respawn on objective completion.

Just start a game and enjoy :)
